        "In real life, shouldn't a wedding be an awesome party you throw with your great pal, in the 
        presence of a bunch of your other friends? A great day, for sure, but not the beginning and 
        certainly not the end of your friendship with a person 
        you can't wait to talk about gardening with for the next forty years."
