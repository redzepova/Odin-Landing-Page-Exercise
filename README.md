# Odin-Landing-Page-Exercise
This was created based on the template as part of the CSS fundamentals course for the Odin Project. I chose to change the fonts, colors, and images to create a website with information about my upcoming wedding.

I've learned that I need to think more abstractly about the structure of the page, and set aside more planning time in order to more effectively use classes versus IDs. I probably need to update git more? 

I worked with a lot of flexboxes, and I would ideally like to make this website readible on mobile.
